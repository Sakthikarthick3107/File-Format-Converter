BLOB

In the context of your JavaScript code snippet, the term blob stands for Binary Large Object. In web 
development, a Blob object represents immutable raw binary data. Blobs are used to handle data like 
images, audio, and video files, as well as other 
binary data that needs to be transferred between the client (browser) and server.
