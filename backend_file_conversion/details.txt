Step 1: Importing Required Modules
APIView from DRF: This is a class provided by Django REST Framework that allows us to create views that can handle RESTful requests (GET, POST, etc.). We inherit from APIView to create our custom view.
Response from DRF: Used to return responses from our API views.
status from DRF: Provides HTTP status codes, which help in returning responses with meaningful HTTP status codes.
canvas from reportlab.pdfgen: This is a class from the reportlab library that allows us to create PDF documents.
HttpResponse from Django: Used to return an HTTP response with a specific content type, in this case, a PDF file.
io.BytesIO: A way to manage file-like objects in memory, useful for generating our PDF before sending it in the response.

Step 2: Defining the ConvertDocumentToPDF Class
This class inherits from APIView and defines a method post to handle POST requests. This is where the document-to-PDF conversion happens.

Step 3: Handling POST Requests
Fetching the Document: The document to be converted is expected to be uploaded with the request. request.FILES.get('document') fetches the uploaded file. If no file is uploaded, the view returns a 400 Bad Request response with an error message.
Setting Up the PDF Response: Before converting the document, it prepares an HttpResponse object with the content type set to application/pdf. This tells the browser that the response is a PDF file. The Content-Disposition header suggests that the browser should download the response as a file named "converted_document.pdf".

Step 4: Generating the PDF
Creating a PDF Canvas: A BytesIO object acts as an in-memory file, and a reportlab canvas is created on this buffer. This canvas is where the text from the document will be drawn.
Drawing the Document's Text: The document's content is read (document.read().decode('utf-8')), decoded from bytes to a string, and drawn onto the PDF canvas at coordinates (100, 100). This is a simplistic approach and might need adjustments for real-world applications to properly format the text.
Finalizing the PDF: p.showPage() finalizes the current page, and p.save() finishes the PDF creation. The buffer's pointer is then reset to the start with buffer.seek(0).

Step 5: Returning the PDF
The content of the BytesIO buffer (now containing the generated PDF) is written to the response object, and this response is returned to the user. When the user receives this response, it will be in the form of a downloadable PDF file.
URL Configuration
This code snippet also includes instructions for setting up the Django URLs to make the ConvertDocumentToPDF view accessible via a web request, specifically at the path api/convert/.

Testing Instructions
Finally, it provides an example curl command to test the API endpoint by uploading a text document for conversion.

This example demonstrates the basic functionality and may need to be expanded or modified depending on specific requirements, such as handling different document formats or more complex PDF generation features.
